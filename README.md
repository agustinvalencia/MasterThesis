# Master Thesis: Reduction of PSU HW faults using AI/ML algorithms

This repo is meant to keep track of my progress in my thesis report

It is based in the template files in [this repo](https://gitlab.liu.se/olale55/liuthesis) which is opened to all LiU students. For privacy I haven't forked it, so I give the proper ackowledgement.
