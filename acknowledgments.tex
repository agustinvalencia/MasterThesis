I want to thank my supervisors Oleg Gorbatov and Lackis Eleftheriadis from Ericsson Research, for their constant support feedback and encouragement throughout this research work. I would like to also thanks Markus Andersson for trusting me and giving me the opportunity to work in such an amazing team. 

I want to thank my examiner Oleg Sysoev and my opponent Namita Sharma, from Linköpings Universitetet, for their advice, constructive criticism and for showing me other perspectives from which to observe this research. 

I am thankful to those who supported me and gave me the energy and strength needed throughout these two years: Sofia, Marcos, Martín, Josefina, Bayu, Ismail, José, Alba, Ying, Zuxiang and many more. You are, without a doubt, part of the journey that has taken me to this point.

Last but not least, I am very grateful to those who are no longer with us, who gave me life and raised me to become the man I am.
